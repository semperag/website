                        This week on my blog, I learned a very cool trick with HTML’s background. You could set 
                        the background to multiple colors intersecting. All that needs to be done is setting the 
                        “background-image” of an element to 
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp" target="_blank">
                            linear-gradient()</a>  
                        like so:

                        <p id="scroll"><pre><code><span class="greenY">#example-div </span>{ 
    <span class="purple">width: </span><span>100px;</span>
    <span class="purple">height: </span><span>100px;</span>
    <span class="purple">background-image: </span><span>linear-gradient(to bottom right, blue, yellow);</span>
}</code></pre></p>

                        <div id="example-div">example-div</div>    
                        
                        If you want to add more than two colors, you can do so by just inserting colors after the 
                        position (in this case it is ‘to bottom right’). This will make my website more eye-popping, 
                        just like this other effect that is known as 
                        <a href="https://www.abeautifulsite.net/a-clean-fade-in-effect-for-webpages" target="_blank">
                            fade-in.</a>  
                        This allows a HTML page to just fade in which I think will look so cool. 

                    </p>									       
                </div>

                <br>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Another very cool thing I learned was a 
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_loader.asp" target="_blank">
                            loading element.</a> 
                        As the name suggests, it is an element that appears to be a circular loading object. This will 
                        be useful for my website’s opening because I can use this loading element to show up instead 
                        of my actual elements loading up and looking bad while doing so. I saw that there is also a 
                        progress bar that is used by the &lt;progress&gt; or &lt;meter&gt; tag, which could also be used as loading 
                        objects. The only problem is they stay at one position, so to increase the progress bar you 
                        need to update it using JavaScript, which is a hassle. Although, this seems useful for when I 
                        would like users to download a file so while waiting, they get a progress bar to know how long it 
                        will take.
