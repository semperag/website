                        In this week of my blog, I have learned many new tricks for CSS to make my 
                        websites look more eye-popping to the readers. This 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLvhAJfx3T0&list=LLEfOzgNhtEvawHzzq_8ItkQ&index=6&t=370s" target="_blank">
                            video </a> 
                        in particular, showed me how to use an image as a background for a container. 
                        All you need to do is add the image file inside a ‘url()’ command and instantiate 
                        the background with it. Not only that, you could also give the background a color 
                        overlay that, in some cases, makes the image less stressful on the eyes and blend 
                        in well with the website. To achieve this, make your container’s position relative 
                        and make a div element, with a background color of your choosing, inside of the 
                        container fit the entire container then make the element’s opacity equal less than 
                        one so you can actually see other items inside that container. Lastly from the video, 
                        a very useful trick was making an element’s z-index equal one. This allows the 
                        element to be in front of everything so the color overlay, or anything else, will 
                        not hide/interfere with it.

                <br>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Other neat things I have learned were from discussion boards or the w3s website. 
                        One thing that was awesome was being allowed to make your own scrollbar. You can 
                        change the color of the scroll bar by using this in your CSS file

                        <p id="scroll"><pre><code>*.class*<span class="greenY">::-webkit-scrollbar </span>{ 
    <span class="purple">width: </span><span>11px;</span>
    <span class="purple">height: </span><span>11px;</span>
    <span class="purple">background-color: </span><span>lightgrey;</span>
}</code></pre></p>

                        <p id="scroll"><pre><code>*.class*<span class="greenY">::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb </span>{ 
    <span class="purple">background: </span><span>blue;</span>
}</code></pre>          <div class="scrollbar-example">This <p>scroll </p><p>bar </p><p>is </p><p>blue</p></div></p>
                            
                        the color goes after the background if that was not obvious. Another amazing trick, from 
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp" target="_blank"> w3schools </a> 
                        , was being able to store a html file into an element for your current file so it would 
                        be able to show itself in your screen. This will be very useful to me at the current 
                        moment because I am intending to build a sort of slideshow website but I want to use html 
                        files to slide either in or out smoothly (I do not want to redirect into files). Also, there 
                        are cool logos use can find in the w3s website, such as this LinkedIn logo.
