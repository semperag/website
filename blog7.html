                        This week I have looked for new knowledge in the React JS area. The first I learned was about portals. 
                        These portals allow for components inside React to become DOM nodes separate from the original application 
                        that it is in. As this 
                        <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/5-expert-reactjs-tips-that-you-need-to-know-today" target="_blank">
                            website</a> 
                        describes “any event that gets triggered inside the portal will bubble up through the parent in React, 
                        rather than into the portal container element itself.” The portal can also be returned by the render 
                        function. If you wanted to display some content, you would be able to put the content inside of this 
                        component and still display in the other element.

                        <pre><code><span class="brown">
ReactDOM.createPortal(
    this.props.children,
    document.getElementById(‘modal’),
);
                    </span></code></pre>								       
                </div>


                <br>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        I also learned that there are tools out there that let you set out rules for your code to abide by. 
                        These tools are called 
                        <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/5-expert-reactjs-tips-that-you-need-to-know-today" target="_blank">
                            linters</a>
                        and will highlight code that do not follow your rules. It is very helpful with working in groups, so code 
                        quality looks about the same for everyone. I do not know if I have learned this in class, but a fragment 
                        is written as &lt;React Fragment&gt;”content”&lt;&#47;&gt;. You are able to write this even shorter and just type &lt;&gt;&lt;&#47;&gt;.
                        And lastly you can call a 
                        <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/8-react-tips-tricks-1f1a429d7da0" target="_blank">
                            functional component</a>
                        just like a regular function. For example:

                        <pre><code><span class="brown">
&lt;SomeComponent&#47;&gt; =&gt; SomeComponent()
                        </span></code></pre>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </main> 
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
