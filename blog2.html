                        For this week of Web Development, I learned the differences between
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFgeJq4l1YM" target="_blank">
                            flex&ndash;grow and flex&ndash;shrink.</a> 
                        Flex-grow allows for a block on the website to take up any free space that 
                        is not being used. Flex-shrink allows for a block to not shrink at all when 
                        the webpage becomes smaller or shrink at a given rate. Another thing I found 
                        out was where I can get emojis to put into my website. This
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp" target="_blank">
                            website</a> 
                        has probably all of the emojis that can be put into HTML and the emoji‚Äôs number 
                        code. It even tells you how to write them in, for example, &quot;&amp;#129409&gt;&quot; 
                        will display ü¶Å.

                    <p>
                        There was also this 
                        <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/articles/web-development/13-cool-tricks-for-html" target="_blank">
                            cool website</a> 
                        that taught me quite a few useful tricks in HTML . 
                        To name some, first one was &quot;&lt;hr&gt;&quot; this adds a horizontal line to break 
                        up long paragraphs of text, so your website looks neater. Another thing would be the 
                        &quot;&lt;/small&gt;&quot;, you would put text in between these, and the text would turn 
                        small and look like fine print. &quot;&lt;/math&gt;&quot; would allow you to show math 
                        equations of your choosing, you just need to specify which one you want. The 
                        website uses a fraction as an example, after &quot;&lt;/math&gt;&quot; you insert 
                        &quot;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&quot; and insert two variables inside these and each variable needs 
                        to also be inside &quot;&lt;/mi&gt;&quot;. Lasty, is being able to highlight text

                        <p><pre><code>&lt;<span class="purple">span</span> <span class="greenY">style</span>=<span class="blue">&quot;background-color: #FFFF00&quot;</span>&gt;Your text here.&lt;/<span class="purple">span</span>&gt;</code></pre></p>
                        <p>Displays: <span style="background-color: #FFFF00;">Your text here.</span></p>
                            
                        <span style="font-style: italic">style=&quot;background-color:&quot;</span> colors the 
                        background of the text you inserted according to the color described you after. I‚Äôm 
                        pretty sure I learned this in my class, but I am not 100% certain so I will add it.
