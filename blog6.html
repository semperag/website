                        This week has been the most confusing for me because we are learning React for JavaScript. 
                        I am still stuck on a few things like changing properties, but I have looked online and got 
                        a better understanding for React while learning new things. I saw that we could use try & 
                        catch statements just like in Java. All you need to do encapsulate the code you want to test 
                        in a try block and then add a catch statement which will run the code in its block if there 
                        is an error present. Error boundaries are a new a new thing in React and makes try & catch 
                        statements so much easier. Error boundaries are described as in this 
                        <a href="https://jsmanifest.com/8-useful-tricks-in-react-you-should-know/" target="_blank">
                            website</a>  
                        “Error boundaries are react components that catch errors anywhere in the component tree, log 
                        them, and can display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.” They can be 
                        written as easy as:

                        <pre><code><span class="brown">
&lt;ErrorBounday&gt;
    &lt;MyWidget &#47;&gt;
&lt;ErrorBoundary &#47;&gt;
                    </span></code></pre>								       
                </div>

                <br>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        I learned another thing called 
                        <a href="https://jsmanifest.com/8-useful-tricks-in-react-you-should-know/" target="_blank">
                            React.useRef.</a> 
                        In class, I was taught that React.useState([]) is used the assign the current value of the component. 
                        React.useRef on the other hand is used to retain the previous value(s) of said component. This is 
                        because the previous component will be assigned by React.useEffect(), it works because after 
                        components finish rendering React.useEffect() runs. A less useful thing I learned was being able to 
                        style components by importing 
                        <a href="https://dev.to/simonholdorf/10-tips-tricks-that-will-make-you-a-better-reactjs-dev-4fhn" target="_blank">
                            ‘styled-components.’</a> 
                        After creating a component, you can assign it to a styled.element 'insert styes here.' Inside the 
                        single quotes, all you need to do is write in original CSS code, you could also write in if 
                        statements with components inside your class to determine which decoration to use.
