                        This week was for me to catch up on things in my CS 347 class. I, am pretty sure that I, 
                        understand what endpoints mean now. They could just be characterized as a 
                        <a href="https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/endpoint/" target="_blank">
                            “URL of a server or service.”</a> 
                        You set an endpoint for your code so that your are able to use helper methods of a 
                        particular server in order to work on or around that server much easier or faster. For 
                        example, Google Cloud gives you an API 
                        <a href="https://cloud.google.com/endpoints" target="_blank">
                            endpoint</a> 
                        so that you are able to click on any button or search for anything by 
                        just running your code, obviously your code has to giving an order to your machine to 
                        access these accessories. With finding out what are endpoints, I also found out that 
                        they must be 
                        <a href="https://geekflare.com/securing-api-endpoint/" target="_blank">
                            secured.</a> 
                        It is best to use HTTPS websites to not risk using a sketchy one. If I am not wrong, 
                        my professor told me to limit the calls of a client so the system will not be overflowing 
                        by a coding error or bots.

                        I was still a bit confused on why we should be using redux. This 
                        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54212798/what-is-redux-for-if-i-use-a-database-for-my-react-app" target="_blank">
                            description</a> 
                        helped my understand it more. With react, you can share data of components if their 
                        parents are the same. But as more and more components are added, new parents are made, 
                        and the code will only become more error prone. Redux allows for the internal state to 
                        be global which makes it accessible to all components. A 
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_state.asp" target="_blank">
                            state</a> is an object that store property values. Internal state being the object 
                            that is inside your code or the code the web service was written on. Here is an 
                            example of a state:

                        <pre><code><span>
<span class="blue">class </span><span class="redP">Car </span><span class="blue">extends </span><span class="redP">React.Component </span>{
    <span class="redP">constructor</span>(props) {
        <span class="blue">super</span>(props);
        <span class="blue">this</span>.state = {brand: <span class="green">"Ford"</span>};
    }
}
                        </span></code></pre>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </main> 
        </div>
    </body>
