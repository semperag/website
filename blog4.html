                        This week was slower than usual, so I have learned fewer things than normal. But 
                        nonetheless, I found out a neat trick that has to do with the 
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp" target="_blank">
                            setTimeout()</a>   
                        function in JavaScript. You can write out

                        <p><pre><code>setTimeout</span>(<span class="blue">myFunction()</span>, <span class="green">3000</span>);</code></pre></p>
                        
                        in JavaScript and the function that would be in “myFunction” would excuted after the 
                        given milliseconds in the second argument. In this case, it would be 3 seconds (or 3000 
                        milliseconds). Another thing I learned was spacing for table rows either vertically or 
                        horizontally. This 
                        <a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-space-between-rows-in-the-table.html" target="_blank">
                            website </a>  
                        shows great examples for learning. You need the border-collapse style to equal separate for 
                        elements inside the table to have their own border, then set border-spacing style to two 
                        variables of pixels of your choosing. The first variable will be the horizontal spacing 
                        between elements in the table and the second will be the vertical spacing. This can be 
                        called inside the table element of your CSS file.

                        A very useful Trick I have learned this week was the 
                        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48239/getting-the-id-of-the-element-that-fired-an-event" target="_blank">
                            event.target.id  </a> 
                        in JavaScript. This will come in handy when you set an array of elements to the same 
                        eventListener and you want to know which element fired off the action/event. You need to 
                        add an argument, usually named "event", to the function the elements will fire off. After 
                        the function executes, you for-loop the array of elements then write an if statement that 
                        compares the event.target.id with each element’s id, and now you will figure out the element 
                        that fired off the event and its position. Lastly, a small cool design trick I found was by using 
                        opacity in CSS. For one of my symbols in my index page, I made its opacity equal 0.3 because 
                        I do not want it to interfere with the background image and make it look ugly. But when the 
                        user hovers over the symbol, its opacity changes to one. This allows the symbol to be semi-transparent 
                        for the background to pop out while becoming clearly visible when needed to be clicked on.
