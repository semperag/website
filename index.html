        <h1>Blog: Week 5</h1>
        Throughout this week, I have learned many small thing 
        including tricks, purposes, and different formats for the 
        same content. CSS you used for appearance of your website and 
        HTML is the format or semantics of the website. I learned about 
        the screen reader and how they help people with visual inability. 
        Programmers can write in id names and alt names for images incase 
        a person would like to hear what they would see on the webpage. 
        For example, writing out 									       
        <p><pre><code>â€˜&lt;img id=&quot;Ziggy&quot; src=&quot;Ziggy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;&gt;</code></pre></p>
        would show an image, Ziggy.jpg, but would read out Ziggy Stardust 
        in alt=&quot;&quot;. Another interesting thing was the input for a color in a 
        .CSS file. You could write in a default name such as red or blue; 
        write in rgb(x, x, x); or write #ffee11 (3 hex-decimal numbers), 
        there might be another way but those are the ones I remember.


        Anothing thing I learned was that the format of a website can be easily 
        changed by using flex. A few features would include flex&ndash;direction, 
        justify/align&ndash;content, and flex&ndash;wrap. In order to use flex, you would 
        need to set the display of an element(s) to flex in the .CSS file. 
        Flex&ndash;direction allows for the corresponding element(s) to be placed 
        into column or row &quot;box.&quot; (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMI_MEMSOow&feature=youtu.be) 
        Justify&ndash;content allows for the element(s) to align horizontally at the 
        left or right side of the website, equal space between element(s), or 
        space inserted before and after each element(s), align is the same but 
        vertically. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jMUbUHTYxM&feature=youtu.be) 
        Lastly, flex&ndash;wrap is generally used for images wrap around page when it 
        touches the end because if there is enough images in row some of them would 
        cut through the website and not be visible.
