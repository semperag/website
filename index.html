        <h1>Blog: Week 5</h1>

        <div>
            <p>
                Throughout this week, I have learned many small thing 
                including tricks, purposes, and different formats for the 
                content. CSS you used for appearance of your website and 
                HTML is the format or semantics of the website. I learned about 
                the screen reader and how they help people with visual inability. 
                Programmers can write in id names and alt names for images incase 
                a person would like to hear what they would see on the webpage. 
                For example, writing out 
            </p>									       
        <p><pre><code>&lt;<span class="purple">img</span> <span class="greenY">id</span>=&quot;<span class="blue">Ziggy</span>&quot; <span class="greenY">src</span>=&quot;<span class="blue">Ziggy.jpg</span>&quot; <span class="greenY">alt</span>=&quot;<span class="blue">Ziggy Stardust</span>&quot;&gt;</code></pre></p>
            <p>
                would show an image, Ziggy.jpg, but would read out Ziggy Stardust 
                in alt=&quot;&quot;. Another interesting thing was the input for a color in a 
                .CSS file. You could write in a default name such as red or blue; 
                write in rgb(x, x, x); or write #ffee11 (3 hex-decimal numbers), 
                there might be another way but those are the ones I remember. 
            </p>
        </div>

            Another thing I learned was that the format of a website can be easily 
            changed by using flex. A few features by flex would include flex&ndash;direction, 
            justify/align&ndash;content, and flex&ndash;wrap. In order to use flex, you would 
            need to set the display of an element(s) to flex in the .CSS file. 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMI_MEMSOow&feature=youtu.be">
                Flex&ndash;direction</a> 
            allows for the corresponding element(s) to be placed into column or row 
            &quot;box.&quot; Justify&ndash;content allows for the element(s) to align 
            horizontally at the left or right side of the website, equal space between 
            element(s), or space inserted before and after each element(s), 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jMUbUHTYxM&feature=youtu.be">
                align&ndash;content</a> 
            is the same but vertically. Lastly, 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR3qVI6ZOUY&feature=youtu.be">
                flex&ndash;wrap</a> 
            is generally used for images wrap around page when it touches the end because if 
            there is enough images in row some of them would cut through the website and not be 
            visible.
